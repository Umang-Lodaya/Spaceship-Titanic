# Spaceship Titanic
## Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension

<br>

## Kaggle Competition Description:
The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.

While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!

## Practice Skills
- Advanced Classification Techniques

## Goal
It is your job to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.

## Metric
Submissions are evaluated based on their classification accuracy, the percentage of predicted labels that are correct.
